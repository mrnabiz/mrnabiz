## Hi there, My name is Nabi 👋
It's Mohammad Reza Nabizadeh Shahrbabak (34 character-name! 🤯 Pretty long, eh?)

🫠 **Fun fact**: When I decided to open an account with RBC bank, I relized the [Wizard of Oz](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/10/learn-speak-dba-slang-terms/) designed the DB like this 👇
```sql
CREATE TABLE accountholder (
    Name varchar(27)
);
```
So I couldn't open a bank account with them.

### 🐣→💡→🚀 About me

I have three masters:
- Master of Science in [Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering](https://nabi.me/resume/msc-geotechnical-engineering) from IUST
- Master of Business Administration [(MBA) in Marketing](https://nabi.me/resume/mba-in-marketing) from University of Tehran
- Master of Science in Data Science from University of British Columbia

For almost eight years, I have worked with tech enterprises like [Huawei Technologies](https://nabi.me/resume/2018-product-marketing-manager) and hyper-growth Canadian startups like [Railz AI](https://nabi.me/resume/2021-demand-generation-manager). I have **managed over a $2M** marketing budget, increased its Return on Investment **(ROI) to 136%**, and **contributed $8.25M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**. As a data-driven marketer, I designed strategies to engage with users and analyzed their behavior metrics, conversions, and retentions for **over 1 million yearly active users**.
