# Hi there, My name is Nabi 👋
It's Mohammad Reza Nabizadeh Shahrbabak (34 character-name! 🤯 Pretty long, eh?)

🫠 **Fun fact**: When I decided to open an account with RBC bank, I realized the [Wizard of Oz](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/10/learn-speak-dba-slang-terms/) designed the DB like this 👇
```sql
CREATE TABLE accountholder (
    Name varchar(27)
);
```
So I couldn't open a bank account with them.

## 🐣→💡→🚀 About me
I have three masters:
- [M.Sc. in Geotechnical & Geoenvironmental Engineering](https://nabi.me/resume/msc-geotechnical-engineering) from Iran University of Science and Technology
- [MBA in Marketing](https://nabi.me/resume/mba-in-marketing) from the University of Tehran
- Master of Science in Data Science from the University of British Columbia, In progress.

For almost eight years, I have worked with tech enterprises like [Huawei Technologies](https://nabi.me/resume/2018-product-marketing-manager) and hyper-growth Canadian startups like [Railz AI](https://nabi.me/resume/2021-demand-generation-manager). I have **managed over a $2M** marketing budget, increased its Return on Investment **(ROI) to 136%**, and **contributed $8.25M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**. As a data-driven marketer, I designed strategies to engage with users and analyzed their behavior metrics, conversions, and retentions for **over 1 million yearly active users**.

Specializing in the design of user research plans and implementation of user behavior tracking platforms, I have developed a range of business metrics dashboards and data analysis tools to evaluate the effectiveness and return on investment of marketing programs.

I have done numerous data analytics in interaction-based customer segmentation, real-time sentiment analysis, causal inference, A/B tests, and purchase tendency prediction. Through my data-driven marketing experience, I have analyzed the customer acquisition cost, predicted the net profit, and optimized the daily ad spending on each marketing channel.
